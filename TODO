1. fix stalemate function
2. refactor block_checking_piece
3. run check_loop for every piece, not just for when king is in check_loop
5. nowhere are we checking whether the person wants to enpassant or just move hte pawn -
   if we were able to en passant but wanted to move hte pawn forward, i'd bbet it would en passant instaed.

6. LEGAL MOVE not being handled, play_round function moves to the next player 


4. create new get_legal_move function and get rid of the loop
4. castle or move piece if statement repeated 3 times
