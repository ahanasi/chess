1. fix stalemate function
2. refactor block_checking_piece
3. run check_loop for every piece, not just for when king is in check_loop
8. Can en-passant into check



DONE

4. create new get_legal_move function and get rid of the loop
5. castle or move piece if statement repeated 3 times
6. LEGAL MOVE not being handled, play_round function moves to the next player
7. nowhere are we checking whether the person wants to enpassant or just move the pawn -
   if we were able to en passant but wanted to move the pawn forward, i'd bbet it would en passant instaed.
   if we are able to en_passant, the pawn can move _anywhere_ without validation, even if it it's an illegal move
